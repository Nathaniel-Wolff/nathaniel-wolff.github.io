<p>Hi there! My name is Nathaniel Wolff, currently based in Oakland, CA. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and a Minor in Bioinformatics, earning highest honors in my major.</p>

<p>I am learning to design mechanistic disease models that leverage bioinformatics to streamline clinical decision-making. I collaborate with physicians and researchers to integrate these models into tools that predict patient outcomes and can be used seamlessly in practice. These tools are patient-centric, using an individual’s unique biological signature to optimize clinical decision making. </p>

<p>I am neurodivergent (ASD, ADHD), and my inherently interdisciplinary brain continues to shape my career trajectory. My experiences inspire me to uplift other neurodivergent voices who may feel their ideas are overlooked. </p>

<p>In my free time, you’ll probably find me cycling up mountains and trails, swimming, cooking a favorite meal, or playing the piano and drums.</p>
