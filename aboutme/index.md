<h1> 👋</h1>
<p>I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2024 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and a Minor in Bioinformatics, with highest honors in the major. Prior to enrolling at UC Santa Cruz, I participated in the Foothill Middle College and College Now programs, where I completed college level math coursework alongside high school coursework. I leveraged my mathematical framework as a 3 time Bioinformatics assistant within UC Santa Cruz’s Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology research groups. In addition to my work at Descartes Learning Club, I am continuing my Bioinformatics assistant work in UC Santa Cruz’s Brangineers Consortium. 

While in Foothill Middle College as a high school student, I tutored a community college student in Basic Math/Precalculus, allowing him to pass his mathematics courses and continue through his educational career. Following this, during my time at UC Santa Cruz, I tutored high school and middle school students in Precalculus, helping these students pass all tutored courses and gain confidence in their study skills and reasoning abilities. Handing these students, each from a different background, allowed me to tutor myself to observe each student’s learning styles and personalize their learning experience.  

In between the start of my graduate school journey, I intend to use my time as a math instructor to help students develop their mathematical framework and confidence in their abilities to solve problems far beyond the math classroom. I will work to ensure that my students come away from their lessons not only prepared for the rigor of math competitions, but prepared to approach the problems they may face beyond math with an analytical eye.  

Helping students realize their potential to solve complex problems in the world and their own lives is why I love tutoring. All students can do amazing things, and I hope to help them develop their confidence in themselves and build the life they dream of.

In my free time, you can find me riding my bike up mountains and trails, swimming in the pool or at the beach,  cooking a nice meal, or at the piano or drums.
