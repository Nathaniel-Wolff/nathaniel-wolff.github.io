<h1> 👋</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Nathaniel Wolff, currently based in Oakland, CA. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and a Minor in Bioinformatics, with highest honors in my major.</p>

<p>I am neurodivergent, diagnosed at age 2 with ASD, and later with ADHD. My neurodivergent brain is inherently interdisciplinary, shaping the trajectory of my career.</p>

<p>Many neurodivergent individuals’ brains, like mine, operate by processing multiple trains of thought at once, one way of describing “divergent thinking”. This way of thinking has caused me to explore the connections between the fields of STEM and use them to develop complex models of biological systems.</p>

<p>This divergent thinking sparked an interest in advanced math in high school, leading me  to complete advanced math coursework at Foothill College while still in high school.</p>

<p>At UC Santa Cruz, to translate the connections between mathematics, computational, and experimental biology into actionable insights, I chose to pursue both Biochemistry and Bioinformatics. </p>

<p>I have leveraged these skills to work successfully with several cross-functional teams, as an intern at Roche Diagnostics and as a multi-time Research Assistant at UC Santa Cruz. At Roche, I collaborated with wet lab scientists to test a novel immunoassay with both computational and experimental methods. At UCSC, I develop bioinformatics pipelines for biophysics and computational neuroscience labs to supplement ongoing bench work.</p>

<p>My interdisciplinary path has resulted in a resume that may not mirror the canonical path of many students in biology, but reflects my unique strengths. </p>

<p>I intend to continue on the path of interdisciplinary biology in graduate programs that emphasize collaboration between clinicians, experimental biologists, mathematicians, and computational biologists alike to develop robust models of biological systems that inform clinical practice. </p>

<p>In my free time, you’ll probably find me cycling up mountains and trails, swimming, cooking a favorite meal, or playing the piano and drums.</p>
