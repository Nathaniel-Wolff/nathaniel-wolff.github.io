<h1>About this project - </h1>
<p>For all of the cost and effort of acne treatment, it is important to quantify how well acne treatment products lead to positive patient outcomes. In particular, we ask: Does repeated use of the same acne treatment eventually lead to diminishing returns in acne severity improvement? Can we quantify those diminishing returns? In this poster, we present a statistical analysis of a longitudinal patient dataset that quantifies the returns of repeated acne treatment on normalized acne severity.</p>
